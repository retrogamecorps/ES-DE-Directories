# ES-DE Directories (Android)
This is a collection of default ES-DE ROM directories, from their Android app.

ES-DE has its own file structure, which makes onboarding very easy -- simply drop your ROMs into the corresponding folder and the app does the rest.  However, this can be annoying if you have already set up your own ROM folders elsewhere, forcing you to copy/paste all of your files to match ES-DE's expected structure.

This release contains all of the ES-DE folders, so you can drop this ROMs folder into a microSD card, and then add all of your games to those corresponding subfolders.  You can then use this setup with whatever frontend you'd like -- but once you're ready to try ES-DE, everything will be organized correctly too.  Just say no to copy/pasting!

# ES-DE Directories (Android)
This is a collection of default <a href="es-de.org">ES-DE</a> ROM directories, from their Android app.

ES-DE has its own file structure, which makes onboarding very easy -- simply drop your ROMs into the corresponding folder and the app does the rest.  However, this can be annoying if you have already set up your own ROM folders elsewhere, forcing you to copy/paste all of your files to match ES-DE's expected structure.

This release contains all of the ES-DE folders, so you can drop this ROMs folder into a microSD card, and then add all of your games to those corresponding subfolders.  You can then use this setup with whatever frontend you'd like -- but once you're ready to try ES-DE, everything will be organized correctly too.  Just say no to copy/pasting!

## Instructions
- Go to the <a href="https://github.com/retrogamecorps/ES-DE-Directories/releases/latest">Releases page</a> and download the latest ROMs.zip release
- Unzip the file and place the `ROMs` folder on your microSD card
- Drop all of your ROMs into their corresponding subfolder
- Pop the card in your Android handheld and enjoy
- If and when you install <a href="es-de.org">ES-DE</a>, point the app to your ROMs directory, and everything should work seamlessly
- Celebrate with a snack and drink

## Credits
- All credit goes to the <a href="es-de.org">ES-DE team</a> and the wonderful frontend they've created.

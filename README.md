# ES-DE-Directories
This is a collection of default ES-DE ROM directories, from their Android app.

The idea is that you can download this release, drop it into a microSD card, and then add all of your ROMs to these pre-named folders.  Then you can use these directories for whatever frontend you'd like; but once you're ready to try ES-DE, everything will be organized correctly too.

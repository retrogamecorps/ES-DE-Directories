# ES-DE Directories (Android)
This is a collection of default <a href="es-de.org">ES-DE</a> ROM directories, from their Android app.

ES-DE creates its own file structure during the setup process, which makes onboarding very easy -- simply drop your ROMs into their corresponding subfolder(s) and the app does the rest.  However, this can be annoying if you have already set up your own ROM folders elsewhere, forcing you to copy/paste all of your files to match ES-DE's expected structure.

This release contains all of the ES-DE folders, so you can drop this ROMs folder into a microSD card, and then add all of your games to those corresponding subfolders.  You can then use this setup with whatever frontend you'd like -- but once you're ready to try ES-DE, everything will be organized correctly too.  _Just say no to copy/pasting!_

## Instructions
- Go to the <a href="https://github.com/retrogamecorps/ES-DE-Directories/releases/latest">Releases page</a> and download the latest ROMs.zip release
- Unzip the file and place the `ROMs` folder on your microSD card
- Drop all of your ROMs into their corresponding subfolder
- Pop the card in your Android handheld and enjoy
- If and when you install <a href="es-de.org">ES-DE</a>, point the app to your ROMs directory, and everything should work seamlessly
- Celebrate with a snack and drink

## Potential use cases
1. You just bought a shiny new handheld and it's taking forever to ship.  While you wait, you could buy a microSD card and build out your ROMs directory so that you can have _immediate gaming nirvana_ on day one
2. Maybe you want to try another great frontend like Daijisho, Beacon, or Console launcher.  Those frontends are folder agnostic, so you could use this ES-DE folder directory on them too.  Then when you're ready to use ES-DE, your ROMs will already be properly organized.
3. You have an old hard drive lying around, and you want to turn it into the **ultimate ROM repository**.  You could use this ROMs folder to organize things in a way that will make it easy to drag and drop them onto a microSD card in the future.

## Credits
- All credit goes to the <a href="es-de.org">ES-DE team</a> and the wonderful frontend they've created.
